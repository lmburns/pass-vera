## pass vera

A command line tool that encrypts your passwords using an encrypted `veracrypt` drive.

This is based off of [`pass-tomb`](https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-tomb) but built to work with macOS instead.  It uses `launchctl` instead of `systemd` to create a timer to automatically close the drive.
